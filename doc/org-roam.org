* Introduction

Org-roam is a [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam Research]] replica built around the
all-powerful [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]].

Org-roam is a solution for effortless non-hierarchical note-taking
with Org-mode. With Org-roam, notes flow naturally, making note-taking
fun and easy. Org-roam should also work as a plug-and-play solution
for anyone already using Org-mode for their personal wiki.

To understand more about Roam, a collection of links are available in
[[*Note-taking Workflows][Note-taking Workflows]].

Org-roam aims to implement the core features of Roam, leveraging the
mature ecosystem around Org-mode where possible. Eventually, we hope
to further introduce features enabled by the Emacs ecosystem.

Org-roam provides several benefits over other tooling:

- Privacy and Security :: Edit your personal wiki completely offline, entirely in your control. Encrypt your notes with GPG.
- Longevity of Plain Text :: Unlike web solutions like Roam research, the notes are first and foremost plain Org-mode files -- Org-roam simply builds up an auxilliary database to give the personal wiki superpowers. Having your notes in plain-text is crucial for the longevity of your wiki. Never have to worry about proprietary web solutions being taken down. Edit your plain-text notes in notepad if all other editors cease to exist
- Free and Open Source :: Org-roam is free and open-source, which means that if you feel unhappy with any part of Org-roam, you may choose to extend Org-roam, or open a PR.
- Leverages the Org-mode ecosystem :: Over the years, Emacs and Org-mode has developed into a mature system for plain-text organization. Building upon Org-mode already puts Org-roam light-years ahead of many other solutions.
- Built on Emacs :: Emacs is also a fantastic interface for editing text, and we can inherit many of the powerful text-navigation and editing packages available to Emacs.
* Installation
** _ :ignore:
Org-roam can be installed using Emacs' package manager or manually from its development repository.

** Installing from MELPA

Org-roam is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable. If you haven't used Emacs' package manager before, you may familiarize yourself with it by reading the documentation in the Emacs manual, see info:emacs#Packages. Then, add one of the archives to =package-archives=:

- To use Melpa:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

- To use Melpa-Stable:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  M-x package-refresh-contents RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once you have done that, you can install Org-roam and its dependencies
using:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  M-x package-install RET org-roam RET
#+END_EXAMPLE
