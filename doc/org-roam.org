* Introduction

Org-roam is a [[https://roamresearch.com/][Roam Research]] replica built around the
all-powerful [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]].

Org-roam is a solution for effortless non-hierarchical note-taking
with Org-mode. With Org-roam, notes flow naturally, making note-taking
fun and easy. Org-roam should also work as a plug-and-play solution
for anyone already using Org-mode for their personal wiki.

To understand more about Roam, a collection of links are available in
[[*Note-taking Workflows][Note-taking Workflows]].

Org-roam aims to implement the core features of Roam, leveraging the
mature ecosystem around Org-mode where possible. Eventually, we hope
to further introduce features enabled by the Emacs ecosystem.

Org-roam provides several benefits over other tooling:

- Privacy and Security :: Edit your personal wiki completely offline, entirely in your control. Encrypt your notes with GPG.
- Longevity of Plain Text :: Unlike web solutions like Roam research, the notes are first and foremost plain Org-mode files -- Org-roam simply builds up an auxilliary database to give the personal wiki superpowers. Having your notes in plain-text is crucial for the longevity of your wiki. Never have to worry about proprietary web solutions being taken down. Edit your plain-text notes in notepad if all other editors cease to exist
- Free and Open Source :: Org-roam is free and open-source, which means that if you feel unhappy with any part of Org-roam, you may choose to extend Org-roam, or open a PR.
- Leverages the Org-mode ecosystem :: Over the years, Emacs and Org-mode has developed into a mature system for plain-text organization. Building upon Org-mode already puts Org-roam light-years ahead of many other solutions.
- Built on Emacs :: Emacs is also a fantastic interface for editing text, and we can inherit many of the powerful text-navigation and editing packages available to Emacs.
* Installation
** _ :ignore:
Org-roam can be installed using Emacs' package manager or manually from its development repository.

** Installing from MELPA

Org-roam is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable. If you haven't used Emacs' package manager before, you may familiarize yourself with it by reading the documentation in the Emacs manual, see info:emacs#Packages. Then, add one of the archives to =package-archives=:

- To use Melpa:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

- To use Melpa-Stable:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  M-x package-refresh-contents RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once you have done that, you can install Org-roam and its dependencies
using:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  M-x package-install RET org-roam RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now see [[*Post-Installation Tasks][Post-Installation Tasks]].

** TODO Installing from the Git Repository

** TODO Post-Installation Tasks

* TODO Getting Started

Org-roam was built to support a workflow that was not possible with vanilla
Org-mode. This flow is modelled after the [[https://zettelkasten.de/][Zettelkasten Method]], and many of [[https://roamresearch.com][Roam Research's]] workflows. It is crucial to understand that Org-roam does not
auto-magically make note-taking better -- it's changing the note-taking workflow
that does. To understand more about the methods and madness, see [[*Note-taking Workflows][Note-taking Workflows]].

In Org-roam, your notes (or zettels), are stored in individual files, in the
=org-roam-directory=. For this tutorial, create an empty directory, and set
=org-roam-directory= accordingly:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(make-directory "~/org-roam")
(setq org-roam-directory "~/org-roam")
#+END_SRC

Org-roam's entry point is the global minor =org-roam-mode=. This sets up Emacs
with several hooks, for keeping the org-roam cache consistently updated, as well
as showing the backlinks buffer.

The cache is a sqlite database named =org-roam.db=, which resides at the root
=org-roam-directory=. Activating =org-roam-mode= builds the cache, which may take a
while the first time, but is often instantaneous in subsequent runs. To build
the cache manually again, run =M-x org-roam-db-build-cache=.

=org-roam-find-file= shows the list of titles for notes that reside in
=org-roam-directory=. Selecting a note title will bring you to the corresponding
note. Entering a title of a note that does not yet exist will create a new note
with that title.

[[file:images/org-roam-find-file.gif]]

Note that in the above image, the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]] completion frontend is used. The default
frontend has some usability issues with non-matching candidates (e.g. when you
want to enter a title of a new note, there is no completion candidate), so
either Ivy or Helm is recommended.

=org-roam-insert= insert links to existing (or new) notes. Entering a non-existent
title will also create a new note with that title.

[[file:images/org-roam-insert-filetag.gif]]

Good usage of Org-roam requires liberally linking files. This allows
the build-up of a dense knowledge graph.

The Org-roam buffer is often displayed in the side window. It shows
backlinks for the currently active Org-roam note, along with some
surrounding context. To bring up toggle the visibility of this buffer, call =M-x org-roam=.

[[file:images/org-roam-buffer.gif]]

Org-roam also provides graphing capabilities, using Graphviz. It generates
graphs with notes as nodes, and links between them as edges. The generated graph
can be used to navigate to the files, but this requires some additional setup (see [[*Roam Protocol][Roam Protocol]]).

* TODO The Templating System

* Roam Protocol
** _ :ignore:
Org-roam extending =org-protocol= with 2 protocols: the =roam-file=
and =roam-ref= protocol.

** Installation

To enable Org-roam's protocol extensions, you have to add the following to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'org-roam-protocol)
#+END_SRC

The instructions for setting up =org-protocol== are reproduced below.

We will also need to create a desktop application for =emacsclient=. The
instructions for various platforms are shown below.

For Linux users, create a desktop application in =~/.local/share/applications/org-protocol.desktop=:

#+begin_example
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Org-Protocol
Exec=emacsclient %u
Icon=emacs-icon
Type=Application
Terminal=false
MimeType=x-scheme-handler/org-protocol
#+end_example

Associate =org-protocol://= links with the desktop application by
running in your shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
xdg-mime default org-protocol.desktop x-scheme-handler/org-protocol
#+END_SRC

To disable the "confirm" prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the =Org-Protocol Client= app will be used
without confirmation. To do this, run in a shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/
sudo tee /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json >/dev/null <<'EOF'
{
  "ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox": true
}
EOF
sudo chmod 644 /etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed/external_protocol_dialog.json
#+END_SRC

and then restart Chrome (for example, by navigating to <chrome://restart>) to
make the new policy take effect.

See [[https://www.chromium.org/administrators/linux-quick-start][here]] for more info on the =/etc/opt/chrome/policies/managed= directory and
[[https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox][here]] for information on the =ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox= policy.

For MacOS, one solution is to use [[https://github.com/sveinbjornt/Platypus][Platypus]]. Here are the instructions for
setting up with Platypus and Chrome:

1. Install and launch Platypus (with [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]]):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
brew cask install platypus
#+END_SRC

2. Create a script =launch_emacs.sh=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
/usr/local/bin/emacsclient --no-wait $1
#+END_SRC

3. Create a Platypus app with the following settings:

#+begin_example
| Setting                        | Value                     |
|--------------------------------+---------------------------|
| App Name                       | "OrgProtocol"             |
| Script Type                    | "env" · "/usr/bin/env"    |
| Script Path                    | "path/to/launch-emacs.sh" |
| Interface                      | None                      |
| Accept dropped items           | true                      |
| Remain running after execution | false                     |
#+end_example


Inside =Settings=:

#+begin_example
| Setting                        | Value          |
|--------------------------------+----------------|
| Accept dropped files           | true           |
| Register as URI scheme handler | true           |
| Protocol                       | "org-protocol" |
#+end_example

To disable the "confirm" prompt in Chrome, you can also make Chrome
show a checkbox to tick, so that the =OrgProtocol= app will be used
without confirmation. To do this, run in a shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
defaults write com.google.Chrome ExternalProtocolDialogShowAlwaysOpenCheckbox -bool true
#+END_SRC


If you're using [[https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport][Emacs Mac Port]], it registered its `Emacs.app` as the default
handler for the URL scheme `org-protocol`. To make =OrgProtocol.app=
the default handler instead, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
defaults write com.apple.LaunchServices/com.apple.launchservices.secure LSHandlers -array-add \
'{"LSHandlerPreferredVersions" = { "LSHandlerRoleAll" = "-"; }; LSHandlerRoleAll = "org.yourusername.OrgProtocol"; LSHandlerURLScheme = "org-protocol";}'
#+END_SRC

Then restart your computer.


** The =roam-file= protocol

This is a simple protocol that opens the path specified by the =file=
key (e.g. =org-protocol://roam-file?file=/tmp/file.org=). This is used
in the generated graph.

** The =roam-ref= Protocol

This protocol finds or creates a new note with a given =ROAM_KEY= (see [[*Anatomy of an Org-roam File][Anatomy of an Org-roam File]]):

[[file:images/roam-ref.gif]]

To use this, create a Firefox bookmarklet as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
javascript:location.href =
'org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='
+ encodeURIComponent(location.href)
+ '&title='
+ encodeURIComponent(document.title)
#+END_SRC

or as a keybinding in =qutebrowser=, adding the following to the =autoconfig.yml= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
settings:
  bindings.commands:
    global:
      normal:
        gc: open javascript:void(location.href='org-protocol://roam-ref?template=r&ref='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title))
#+END_SRC

where =template= is the template key for a template in
=org-roam-capture-ref-templates= (see [[*The Templating System][The Templating System]]). These templates
should contain a =#+ROAM_KEY: ${ref}= in it.
