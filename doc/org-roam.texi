@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Org-roam is a @uref{https://roamresearch.com/, Roam Research} replica built around the
all-powerful @uref{https://orgmode.org/, Org-mode}.

Org-roam is a solution for effortless non-hierarchical note-taking
with Org-mode. With Org-roam, notes flow naturally, making note-taking
fun and easy. Org-roam should also work as a plug-and-play solution
for anyone already using Org-mode for their personal wiki.

To understand more about Roam, a collection of links are available in
@ref{Note-taking Workflows}.

Org-roam aims to implement the core features of Roam, leveraging the
mature ecosystem around Org-mode where possible. Eventually, we hope
to further introduce features enabled by the Emacs ecosystem.

Org-roam provides several benefits over other tooling:

@table @asis
@item Privacy and Security
Edit your personal wiki completely offline, entirely in your control. Encrypt your notes with GPG@.
@item Longevity of Plain Text
Unlike web solutions like Roam research, the notes are first and foremost plain Org-mode files -- Org-roam simply builds up an auxilliary database to give the personal wiki superpowers. Having your notes in plain-text is crucial for the longevity of your wiki. Never have to worry about proprietary web solutions being taken down. Edit your plain-text notes in notepad if all other editors cease to exist
@item Free and Open Source
Org-roam is free and open-source, which means that if you feel unhappy with any part of Org-roam, you may choose to extend Org-roam, or open a PR@.
@item Leverages the Org-mode ecosystem
Over the years, Emacs and Org-mode has developed into a mature system for plain-text organization. Building upon Org-mode already puts Org-roam light-years ahead of many other solutions.
@item Built on Emacs
Emacs is also a fantastic interface for editing text, and we can inherit many of the powerful text-navigation and editing packages available to Emacs.

@node Installation
@chapter Installation

Org-roam can be installed using Emacs' package manager or manually from its development repository.

@node Installing from MELPA
@section Installing from MELPA

Org-roam is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable. If you haven't used Emacs' package manager before, you may familiarize yourself with it by reading the documentation in the Emacs manual, see @ref{Packages,,,emacs,}. Then, add one of the archives to @samp{package-archives}:

@itemize
@item
To use Melpa:
@end itemize

@lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
@end lisp

@itemize
@item
To use Melpa-Stable:
@end itemize

@lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
@end lisp

Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using:

@example
M-x package-refresh-contents RET
@end example

Once you have done that, you can install Org-roam and its dependencies
using:

@example
M-x package-install RET org-roam RET
@end example

Now see @ref{Post-Installation Tasks}.
